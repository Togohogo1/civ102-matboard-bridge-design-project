necessary

to open as live script, right click tab and select open as live script
- i plan to use comments for inline code notes (i played around with
converting from live script to .m file with fancy markdown and it didn't
work as well as expected
- we will be submitting raw code anyway so editing .m files (and converting
to .mlx files when necessary) would be more ideal
%}

a = [1 2 3];

% Plots not to command window (hexagram best marker)
plot(4, 4, "hexagram")

%% Questions
